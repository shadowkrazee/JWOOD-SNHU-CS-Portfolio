# CS 305 - Software security

`Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?`

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.
Global Rain helped this client to ensure the security of their applications using various software security best practices.

`What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?`

Once the vulnerabilities are identified, implementing the fixes is my favorite part. Code security is a huge deal because every aspect of our lives is (or will be) dependent on software these days, and when that software is designed with security at the forefront, we all benefit. Less data breaches, less personal info leaked, less vulnerability to attacks and exploints that can interrupt services, etc. This security adds value to a company by reducing the likelihood of outages and cyber attacks / data leaks, reducing the risk and liability assumed by creating the software solution in the first place.

`What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?`

As a developer, the reports and "paperwork" aspect of this process was a challenge to me, as I vastly prefer solving problems and coding over the more "human" aspects of the field.

`How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?`

I increased security by implementing HTTPS using self-signed RSA keys, and providing file authenticity validation using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.

`How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?`

Security implementations were validated by testing the functionality, and through use of static code analysis tools from OWASP before and after implementation.

`What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks`

Use of hashing algorithms, static code analysis, key generation and HTTPS implementation are all useful skills when it comes to developing a secure application, or securing an existing one.

`Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?`

The Project 2 "Secure Software Report" and codebase would definitely be the big one from this class. The tasking combined much of what we learned through the course into one codebase so we got to apply everything we learned to a "real-life" scenario.

# CS 255 - System Analysis and Design

`Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?`

DriverPass is a learning platform with the aim of educating new drivers through online courses and in-person lessons so that they can confidently pass their driving test the first time, and their parents have some peace of mind knowing their kids have all of the knowledge required to stay safe on the road.

`What did you do particularly well?`

I learned alot about the different types of diagrams used to illustrate the components, use cases, and sequences involved in an application like this. I feel that I did well with these diagrams.

`If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?`

I don't think there's any area in particular that needs revsision or improvement.

`How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?`

Most of the customer's needs were extracted from transcripts of in-person interviews, turned into functional and non-functional requirements, and compiled into requirement documents, diagrams, and a plan to execute the project. It is important to consider the users' needs because the entire reason they came to you was to have a need fulfilled, and if you can satisfy a customer's needs, they're likely to recommend your services to other potential customers.

`How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?`

In order to have a cohesive, well thought out solution, you must first understand the problem. Analysis and requirements gathering ensure that the planned solution will satisfy all of the needs, then all that's left is to set the plan in motion, and try to keep the train on the tracks. In the future I will try and focus a bit more on the requirements and planning portion of my projects a bit more, as I think it will increase the quality of the finished product.

# CS 250 - Software Development Life Cycle

`How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?`

The process of requirements gathering helps to distill functional requirements from discussions with users and other stakeholders into a simple checklist. Assembling that checklist into user stories aids in the tracking of progress, and testing whether or not the users' needs are met by the product.

`How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?`

Application development is the process of building a solution to meet a set of specifications. The iterative approach of agile methodologies helps to deliver value in small increments over time, rather than attempting to build the whole solution in one "long sprint". This allows for gradual progress towards the customers' goals, without the risk that the end product is not what the customer envisioned from the beginning. I have, and will continue to implement an iterative approach to my personal projects and business endeavors.

`What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?`

A good team member is someone who does their part, helps others, and does their best to ensure that the work they produce helps to push the poject as a whole in the right direction.

# CS 230 - Operating Platforms

`Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?`

The Gaming Room was a CTS client that sought to create a multi-platform game called "Draw It or Lose It", allowing players on desktop and mobile platforms to play together in a "Win, Lose, or Draw" style game where players attempt to guess the subject of a drawing as it is gradually uncovered. The game supported team and solo play, a web version, and IOS and Android applications, and was fun to work on.

`What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?`

I would say that I did a good job of comparing traditional operating platforms and devlopment practices with their cloud-based alternatives, and made the most appropriate, cost-effective recommendations based on the client's goals.

`What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?`

The documentation served to organize my thoughts and ideas in a way that made it easier to understand end-to-end than if I were to have tried to imagine it all up in my head. This organization and planning overall leads to a better solution by allowing "the vision" to be seen by others, reviewed by the client, and adapted until all parties are happy with the plan and development can begin.

`If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?`

I think I'd like to review the entire document as a whole and work to make it more cohesive. It feels as if it were developed in several independent sections, rather than as one large project.

`How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?`

The goal of any software is to provide value to the user, either as a tool, a service, or entertainment. If a project doesn't consider the user's needs and experience as part of development, it's sure to underwhelm, and not likely to suceed.

`How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?`

My approach was largely experience based. The client's goals were pretty well in line with some projects I have worked on, so I applied that knowledge to create a solution for the Gaming Room. In the future, I will try to do more research before jumping for the "tried and true" easy answer, to ensure that I am providing the best solution for the client, and not just the easiest solution for me to implement.
