`Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?`

The Gaming Room was a CTS client that sought to create a multi-platform game called "Draw It or Lose It", allowing players on desktop and mobile platforms to play together in a "Win, Lose, or Draw" style game where players attempt to guess the subject of a drawing as it is gradually uncovered. The game supported team and solo play, a web version, and IOS and Android applications, and was fun to work on.

`What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?`

I would say that I did a good job of comparing traditional operating platforms and devlopment practices with their cloud-based alternatives, and made the most appropriate, cost-effective recommendations based on the client's goals.

`What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?`

The documentation served to organize my thoughts and ideas in a way that made it easier to understand end-to-end than if I were to have tried to imagine it all up in my head. This organization and planning overall leads to a better solution by allowing "the vision" to be seen by others, reviewed by the client, and adapted until all parties are happy with the plan and development can begin.

`If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?`

I think I'd like to review the entire document as a whole and work to make it more cohesive. It feels as if it were developed in several independent sections, rather than as one large project.

`How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?`

The goal of any software is to provide value to the user, either as a tool, a service, or entertainment. If a project doesn't consider the user's needs and experience as part of development, it's sure to underwhelm, and not likely to suceed.

`How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?`

My approach was largely experience based. The client's goals were pretty well in line with some projects I have worked on, so I applied that knowledge to create a solution for the Gaming Room. In the future, I will try to do more research before jumping for the "tried and true" easy answer, to ensure that I am providing the best solution for the client, and not just the easiest solution for me to implement.
